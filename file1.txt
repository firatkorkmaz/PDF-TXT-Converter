The 2030 World Cup will be held across six countries in three continents, Fifa has 
confirmed.  
 
Spain, Portugal and Morocco have been named as the co -hosts, with the opening three matches 
taking place in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay.  
 
The opening matches in South America are to mark the World Cup's centenary as it will be 100 
years since the inaugural tournament in Montevideo.  
 
The decision is set to be ratified at a Fifa congress next year.  
 
Fifa also confirmed only bids from countries from the As ian Football Confederation and the 
Oceania Football Confederation will be considered for the 2034 finals.  
 
Following that decision, Saudi Arabia announced it would be bidding to host the tournament in 
2034 for the first time.  
 
The deadline for prospective hosts to submit confirmations of interest is 31 October.  
 
Fifa's decision to host the 2030 tournament across multiple continents has drawn criticism, with 
one supporter's body accusing football's world governing body of engaging in a "cycle of 
destruction  against the greatest tournament on Earth".  
 
"[It's] horrendous for supporters, disregards the environment and rolls the red carpet out to a host

said Football Su pporters Europe.
