The Texas Rangers are World Series champions for the first time in the franchise’s 63 -season 
history, defeating the Arizona Diamondbacks 5 -0-Wednesday in Phoenix to secure the title in 
Game 5.  
The Rangers’ win in Phoenix – giving them the best -of-seven series 4 games to 1 – didn’t come 
easily.  
The game was scoreless through six innings, and Diamondbacks starting pitcher Zac Gallen was 
dominating, not allowing a hit through those stanzas.  
But Rangers starting pitcher Nathan Eovaldi also fared well, keeping the Diamondbacks blanked 
through his six innings of work, despite being under frequent threat. Arizona was 0 -for-9 with 
runners in scoring position with Eovaldi on the mound.  
And in the seventh inning, the Rangers finally got to Gallen.  
Rangers shortstop Corey Seager, famed for his clutch World Series performances, broke up the 
no-hitter in the seventh, and two batters later, Mitch Garver’s single scored Seager for the 
game’s first run.  
The Rangers then pounced on Arizona in the ninth inning, scoring four more runs - highlighted 
by a monster Marcus Semien 2 -run home run off Paul Sewald deep to center field for an 
unsurmountable 5 -0 lead.  
“Man, this is the biggest moment,” an emotional Semien told Fox Sports when asked about his 
home run. “Just felt so good. Just looked over at the bench (and) screamed. Just an unbelievable 
feeling. I know I keep saying that word, but just to run the bases knowing that we are that much 
closer felt great.”
